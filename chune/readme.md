# Chune

Chune is a webapp that allows anyone to add songs to your spotify queue. This enables you to plug 
in to your speakers when hosting a party and let people request songs without having to get your
attention or physically access your spotify device.

Chune is written in Python3 using Flask and Spotipy.

## WARNING

Chune is not designed to be secure, use at your own risk. As far as I can tell, the only danger is 
attackers queueing songs on your spotify - not the end of the world. I am however not a security
expert and therefore give no guarantees of safety or privacy.
